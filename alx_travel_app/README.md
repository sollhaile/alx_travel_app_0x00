# Milestone 1: Setup and Database Configuration

## About the Project

The alxtravelapp project is a real-world Django application that serves as the foundation for a travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on setting up the initial project structure, configuring a robust database, and integrating tools to ensure API documentation and maintainable configurations. 

The aim is to equip learners with industry-standard best practices for starting and managing Django-based projects efficiently.

This milestone will teach you to set up a scalable backend, integrate MySQL for database management, and use Swagger for automated API documentation. These foundational steps are critical in preparing the application for future features and seamless team collaboration.

## Learning Objective

### Master Advanced Project Initialization:

    Learn to bootstrap Django projects with modular, production-ready configurations.

    Employ environment variable management for secure and scalable settings.

### Integrate Key Developer Tools:

    Set up and use Swagger (via drf-yasg) for API documentation.

    Implement CORS headers and MySQL configurations for robust API interactions.

### Collaborate Effectively Using Git:

    Structure your projects for team collaboration with a version-controlled setup.

### Adopt Industry Best Practices:

    Follow best practices in managing dependencies, database configurations, and application structure.

## Requirements
    Skills prerequisites:

Familiarity with Django and Django REST Framework.
Knowledge of MySQL and database management.
Understanding of version control using Git.
A basic grasp of environment variable management using django-environ.


# Key Highlights

## Project Initialization:

Create a Django project named alxtravelapp.
Add an app named listings to encapsulate core functionalities.

## Dependency Management:

Install essential packages:
django: Core framework for application development.
djangorestframework: REST API development.
django-cors-headers: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing setup.
drf-yasg: Swagger API documentation.
celery and rabbitmq: For future task queuing and background processes.

## Settings Configuration:

Use django-environ to securely handle environment variables in .env files.
Configure MySQL as the primary database, ensuring proper connection handling in settings.py.
Set up REST framework and CORS headers for API support.

## Swagger Integration:

Integrate Swagger for comprehensive API documentation.
Ensure all APIs are automatically documented and accessible at /swagger/.

## Version Control and Submission:

Initialize a Git repository and commit all project setup files.
Push your code to a GitHub repository named alxtravelapp with the specified structure.

# Tasks

0. Django Project Setup with API Documentation and Database Configuration
mandatory

### Objective

Set up the Django project with the necessary dependencies, configure the database, and add Swagger for API documentation.

### Instructions

### Create a Django Project:

Set up a new Django project named alx_travel_app.
Create an app within the project named listings.
Install necessary packages, including django, djangorestframework, django-cors- headers, celery, rabbitmq, and drf-yasg for Swagger documentation.

### Configure Settings:

In settings.py, configure the project for REST framework and CORS headers.
Set up the database configuration to use MYSQL. Use environment variables for sensitive information such as database credentials. (Hint: Use the django-environ package to handle .env files).

### Add Swagger:

Install drf-yasg for Swagger documentation.
Configure Swagger to automatically document all APIs. The documentation should be available at /swagger/.

### Initialize Git Repository:

Initialize a Git repository and make your initial commit with the project setup files.

## Repo:

GitHub repository: alx_travel_app
Directory: alx_travel_app
File: alx_travel_app/requirement.txt, alx_travel_app/listings, alx_travel_app/settings.py, alx_travel_app/urls.py
